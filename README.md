The **Collatz Conjecture**, also known as the **3n+1 conjecture** or the **hailstone sequence**, is a mathematical conjecture that concerns a sequence of numbers generated by a specific rule. The conjecture is named after the German mathematician **Lothar Collatz**, who first proposed it in 1937.

Here's a step-by-step instruction on how the Collatz Conjecture works:

- Start with any positive integer *`n`*
- If *`n`* is even, divide it by **2** to get *`n/2`*
- If *`n`* is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1 to get *`3n + 1`*
- Repeat the process with the result obtained in step 2 or step 3, and continue applying the same rules to each subsequent number in the sequence.

> The conjecture states that, regardless of the initial value of
*`n`*, this sequence will eventually reach the number 1. Once the sequence reaches 1, it will continue in a loop: 1 → 4 → 2 → 1

For example, let's make the starting number 6, so `n = 6`:


1) ***6*** is even, `6/2 = 3`
2) ***3*** is odd, `3*3 + 1 = 10`
3) ***10*** is even, `10/2 = 5`
4) ***5*** is odd, `5*3 + 1 = 16`
5) ***16*** is even, `16/2 = 8`
6) ***8*** is even, `8/2 = 4`
7) ***4*** is even, `4/2 = 2`
8) ***2*** is even, `2/2 = 1`
9) ***1*** is odd, `1*3 + 1 = 4`
10) ***4*** is even, `4/2 = 2`
11) ***2*** is even, `2/2 = 1`
12) ***1*** is odd, `1*3 + 1 = 4`
13) ***4*** is even, `4/2 = 2`
14) ***2*** is even, `2/2 = 1`

This is what it would look like plotted on a graph:

As you can see, once the sequence reaches **4** it begins looping 4 - 2 - 1 endlessly.
Mathematically you can easily understand and see exactly why this happens given the
two "*rules*" or calculations being applied to even and odd numbers. Although while the 
conjecture is relatively easy to understand and has been tested extensively for many 
values of `n` using computers and otherwise, a formal proof of the conjecture's validity 
or counterexample (*a number that doesn't follow the sequence to 1*) has eluded 
mathematicians for decades. The Collatz Conjecture remains one of the most famous 
unsolved problems in number theory. Despite its simplicity, its behavior becomes 
incredibly complex as the numbers involved increase, making it a fascinating and really cool area of study in mathematics. 

To demonstrate I'll show you the same sequence using a larger number
like **75** as the seed.

As you can see no matter the number we end up in the same loop at the end again,  4 - 2 - 1 - 4 - 2 - 1 ... The following image is a zoomed in section of the above graph where the looping starts:
