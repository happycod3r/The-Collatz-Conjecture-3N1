The **Collatz Conjecture**, also known as the **3n+1 conjecture** or the **hailstone sequence**, is a mathematical conjecture that concerns a sequence of numbers generated by a specific rule. The conjecture is named after the German mathematician **Lothar Collatz**, who first proposed it in 1937.

Here's a step-by-step instruction on how the Collatz Conjecture works:

- Start with any positive integer *`n`*
- If *`n`* is even, divide it by **2** to get *`n/2`*
- If *`n`* is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1 to get *`3n + 1`*
- Repeat the process with the result obtained in step 2 or step 3, and continue applying the same rules to each subsequent number in the sequence.

The conjecture states that, regardless of the initial value of
*`n`*, this sequence will eventually reach the number 1. Once the sequence reaches 1, it will continue in a loop: 1 → 4 → 2 → 1

For example, let's make the starting number 6, so `n = 6`:


1) ***6*** is even, `6/2 = 3`
2) ***3*** is odd, `3*3 + 1 = 10`
3) ***10*** is even, `10/2 = 5`
4) ***5*** is odd, `5*3 + 1 = 16`
5) ***16*** is even, `16/2 = 8`
6) ***8*** is even, `8/2 = 4`
7) ***4*** is even, `4/2 = 2`
8) ***2*** is even, `2/2 = 1`
9) ***1*** is odd, `1*3 + 1 = 4`
10) ***4*** is even, `4/2 = 2`
11) ***2*** is even, `2/2 = 1`
12) ***1*** is odd, `1*3 + 1 = 4`
13) ***4*** is even, `4/2 = 2`
14) ***2*** is even, `2/2 = 1`
15) ***1*** is odd, `1*3 + 1 = 4`

This is what it would look like plotted on a graph:
